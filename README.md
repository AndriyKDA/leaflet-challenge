# leaflet-challenge
This assignment contains the code to desiplay the earthquake infromation on the map using USGS weekly data in JSON format. 

Devliverable Outline: 

1) Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

2) added data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

3) Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

4) Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
